# Hackout-21
We ported our SKLearn model to tensorflow to harness the power of Natural Language processing using the Natural language toolkit to increase user friendliness and give a more human like feel to the chat bot. Our tensorflow model achieved ~99% accuracy proving it to be a good replacement to human chat assistants. 
Our model can be improved upon by using a custom and more tailored dataset lying in a more specific healthcare domain to get a bespoke outlook. We also developed a stunning Flask based WebApp for interaction with the ChatBot. 

Currently our chatbot responds to the most basic of healthcare queries.
